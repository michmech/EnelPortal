# European Dictionary Portal

This is the source code for the [European Dictonary Portal](http://www.dictionaryportal.eu/).

- The website is an ASP.NET application and can be found in the `Website` folder.

- The back-end database is an SQL Server database and can be found in the `Database` folder.

- The list of dictionaries can be found in the `Catalog` folder, but this is only an occasional backup and is not necessarily up to date. The most recent version can always be [downloaded](http://www.dictionaryportal.eu/en/dnld/) from the portal itself.
